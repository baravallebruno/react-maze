## Alien Maze Escape

Welcome to Alien Maze Escape! This React application, built with TypeScript, is a fun and engaging project where an alien must find its way out of a complex maze. The maze is rendered in a grid format, and the alien (represented by an avatar) automatically navigates through the maze, avoiding obstacles and finding the exit.

### Features

- Maze Rendering: Displays a maze using a grid layout, where each cell can be a starting point ("Start"), an exit ("Exit"), a walkable path ("Empty"), or a wall ("Wall").
- Automatic Pathfinding: The alien avatar automatically navigates through the maze using a pathfinding algorithm to find the exit.
- Movement Tracking: The movements of the alien are tracked and sent to a specified API endpoint upon solving the maze.

### Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
